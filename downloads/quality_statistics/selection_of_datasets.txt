The quality metrics were determined on all 805 ENCODE datasets for transcription factors in BAM format.
For the determination of quality metric thresholds only 392 datasets were used.
234 datasets with a read length different from 36 were discarded.
Furthermore, 139 datasets with an estimated average fragment length less than 100 were discarded.
40 datasets of the remaining 432 datasets were controls.
Only the 392 datasets for treatment datasets were used.
